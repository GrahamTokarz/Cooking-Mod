# Cooking-Mod
A personal effort to add content modded content to Terraria

This project mainly self-written code, with some basic outlines used to communicate with Terraria. The images are also mainly self-created, although other students have
helped me with some of them. This project is a way for me to apply my love of programming into a game that my friends and I play regularly.
